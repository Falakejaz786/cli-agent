If you also want to resolve any links to the script itself, you need a multi-line solution:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nget_script_dir()\n{\n    local SOURCE_PATH=\"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\"\n    local SYMLINK_DIR\n    local SCRIPT_DIR\n    # Resolve symlinks recursively\n    while [ -L \"$SOURCE_PATH\" ]; do\n        # Get symlink directory\n        SYMLINK_DIR=\"$( cd -P \"$( dirname \"$SOURCE_PATH\" )\" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd )\"\n        # Resolve symlink target (relative or absolute)\n        SOURCE_PATH=\"$(readlink \"$SOURCE_PATH\")\"\n        # Check if candidate path is relative or absolute\n        if [[ $SOURCE_PATH != /* ]]; then\n            # Candidate path is relative, resolve to full path\n            SOURCE_PATH=$SYMLINK_DIR/$SOURCE_PATH\n        fi\n    done\n    # Get final script directory path from fully resolved source path\n    SCRIPT_DIR=\"$(cd -P \"$( dirname \"$SOURCE_PATH\" )\" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd)\"\n    echo \"$SCRIPT_DIR\"\n}\n\necho \"get_script_dir: $(get_script_dir)\"\n\nThis last one will work with any combination of aliases, source, bash -c, symlinks, etc.\nBeware: if you cd to a different directory before running this snippet, the result may be incorrect!\nAlso, watch out for $CDPATH gotchas, and stderr output side effects if the user has smartly overridden cd to redirect output to stderr instead (including escape sequences, such as when calling update_terminal_cwd >&2 on Mac). Adding >/dev/null 2>&1 at the end of your cd command will take care of both possibilities.\nTo understand how it works, try running this more verbose form:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nSOURCE=${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\nwhile [ -L \"$SOURCE\" ]; do # resolve $SOURCE until the file is no longer a symlink\n  TARGET=$(readlink \"$SOURCE\")\n  if [[ $TARGET == /* ]]; then\n    echo \"SOURCE '$SOURCE' is an absolute symlink to '$TARGET'\"\n    SOURCE=$TARGET\n  else\n    DIR=$( dirname \"$SOURCE\" )\n    echo \"SOURCE '$SOURCE' is a relative symlink to '$TARGET' (relative to '$DIR')\"\n    SOURCE=$DIR/$TARGET # if $SOURCE was a relative symlink, we need to resolve it relative to the path where the symlink file was located\n  fi\ndone\necho \"SOURCE is '$SOURCE'\"\nRDIR=$( dirname \"$SOURCE\" )\nDIR=$( cd -P \"$( dirname \"$SOURCE\" )\" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd )\nif [ \"$DIR\" != \"$RDIR\" ]; then\n  echo \"DIR '$RDIR' resolves to '$DIR'\"\nfi\necho \"DIR is '$DIR'\"\n\nAnd it will print something like:\nSOURCE './scriptdir.sh' is a relative symlink to 'sym2/scriptdir.sh' (relative to '.')\nSOURCE is './sym2/scriptdir.sh'\nDIR './sym2' resolves to '/home/ubuntu/dotfiles/fo fo/real/real1/real2'\nDIR is '/home/ubuntu/dotfiles/fo fo/real/real1/real2'"

    "question": "How can I check if a program exists from a Bash script?",
    "answer": "Answer\nPOSIX compatible:\ncommand -v <the_command>\n\nExample use:\nif ! command -v <the_command> >/dev/null 2>&1\nthen\n    echo \"<the_command> could not be found\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\nFor Bash specific environments:\nhash <the_command> # For regular commands. Or...\ntype <the_command> # To check built-ins and keywords\n\nExplanation\nAvoid which. Not only is it an external process you're launching for doing very little (meaning builtins like hash, type or command are way cheaper), you can also rely on the builtins to actually do what you want, while the effects of external commands can easily vary from system to system.\nWhy care?\n\nMany operating systems have a which that doesn't even set an exit status, meaning the if which foo won't even work there and will always report that foo exists, even if it doesn't (note that some POSIX shells appear to do this for hash too).\nMany operating systems make which do custom and evil stuff like change the output or even hook into the package manager.\n\nSo, don't use which. Instead use one of these:\ncommand -v foo >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo >&2 \"I require foo but it's not installed.  Aborting.\"; exit 1; }\n\ntype foo >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo >&2 \"I require foo but it's not installed.  Aborting.\"; exit 1; }\n\nhash foo 2>/dev/null || { echo >&2 \"I require foo but it's not installed.  Aborting.\"; exit 1; }\n\n(Minor side-note: some will suggest 2>&- is the same 2>/dev/null but shorter – this is untrue.  2>&- closes FD 2 which causes an error in the program when it tries to write to stderr, which is very different from successfully writing to it and discarding the output (and dangerous!))\n(Additional minor side-note: some will suggest &>/dev/null, but this is not POSIX compliant)\nIf your hash bang is /bin/sh then you should care about what POSIX says. type and hash's exit codes aren't terribly well defined by POSIX, and hash is seen to exit successfully when the command doesn't exist (haven't seen this with type yet).  command's exit status is well defined by POSIX, so that one is probably the safest to use.\nIf your script uses bash though, POSIX rules don't really matter anymore and both type and hash become perfectly safe to use. type now has a -P to search just the PATH and hash has the side-effect that the command's location will be hashed (for faster lookup next time you use it), which is usually a good thing since you probably check for its existence in order to actually use it.\nAs a simple example, here's a function that runs gdate if it exists, otherwise date:\ngnudate() {\n    if hash gdate 2>/dev/null; then\n        gdate \"$@\"\n    else\n        date \"$@\"\n    fi\n}"

The first author also added this as a comment next to the code using this solution giving the URL to this answer, which now also includes the explanation for why the quotes can be safely omitted.\n(Often) The wrong way\nif [ -z \"$var\" ]; then echo \"var is blank\"; else echo \"var is set to '$var'\"; fi\n\nThis is often wrong because it doesn't distinguish between a variable that is unset and a variable that is set to the empty string. That is to say, if var='', then the above solution will output \"var is blank\".\nThe distinction between unset and \"set to the empty string\" is essential in situations where the user has to specify an extension, or additional list of properties, and that not specifying them defaults to a non-empty value, whereas specifying the empty string should make the script use an empty extension or list of additional properties.\nThe distinction may not be essential in every scenario though. In those cases  [ -z \"$var\" ] will be just fine."

If you want to allow more flexible input (accepting the words of the options, rather than just their number), you can alter it like this:\necho \"Do you wish to install this program?\"\nselect strictreply in \"Yes\" \"No\"; do\n    relaxedreply=${strictreply:-$REPLY}\n    case $relaxedreply in\n        Yes | yes | y ) make install; break;;\n        No  | no  | n ) exit;;\n    esac\ndone\n\n\nAlso, Léa Gris demonstrated a way to make the request language agnostic in her answer. Adapting my first example to better serve multiple languages might look like this:\nset -- $(locale LC_MESSAGES)\nyesexpr=\"$1\"; noexpr=\"$2\"; yesword=\"$3\"; noword=\"$4\"\n\nwhile true; do\n    read -p \"Install (${yesword} / ${noword})? \" yn\n    if [[ \"$yn\" =~ $yesexpr ]]; then make install; exit; fi\n    if [[ \"$yn\" =~ $noexpr ]]; then exit; fi\n    echo \"Answer ${yesword} / ${noword}.\"\ndone\n\nObviously other communication strings remain untranslated here (Install, Answer) which would need to be addressed in a more fully completed translation, but even a partial translation would be helpful in many cases.\n\nFinally, please check out the excellent answer by F.

    "question": "Difference between sh and Bash",
    "answer": "What is sh?\nsh (or the Shell Command Language) is a programming language described by the POSIX standard. It has many implementations (ksh88, Dash, ...). Bash can also be considered an implementation of sh (see below).\nBecause sh is a specification, not an implementation, /bin/sh is a symlink (or a hard link) to an actual implementation on most POSIX systems.\nWhat is Bash?\nBash started as an sh-compatible implementation (although it predates the POSIX standard by a few years), but as time passed it has acquired many extensions. Many of these extensions may change the behavior of valid POSIX shell scripts, so by itself Bash is not a valid POSIX shell. Rather, it is a dialect of the POSIX shell language.\nBash supports a --posix switch, which makes it more POSIX-compliant. It also tries to mimic POSIX if invoked as sh.\nsh = bash?\nFor a long time, /bin/sh used to point to /bin/bash on most GNU/Linux systems. As a result, it had almost become safe to ignore the difference between the two. But that started to change recently.\nSome popular examples of systems where /bin/sh does not point to /bin/bash (and on some of which /bin/bash may not even exist) are:\n\nModern Debian and Ubuntu systems, which symlink sh to dash by default;\nBusybox, which is usually run during the Linux system boot time as part of initramfs. It uses the ash shell implementation.\nBSD systems, and in general any non-Linux systems. OpenBSD uses pdksh, a descendant of the KornShell. FreeBSD's sh is a descendant of the original Unix Bourne shell.  Solaris has its own sh which for a long time was not POSIX-compliant; a free implementation is available from the Heirloom project.\n\nHow can you find out what /bin/sh points to on your system?\nThe complication is that /bin/sh could be a symbolic link or a hard link. If it's a symbolic link, a portable way to resolve it is:\n% file -h /bin/sh\n/bin/sh: symbolic link to bash\n\nIf it's a hard link, try\n% find -L /bin -samefile /bin/sh\n/bin/sh\n/bin/bash\n\nIn fact, the -L flag covers both symlinks and hardlinks,\nbut the disadvantage of this method is that it is not portable —\nPOSIX does not require find to support the -samefile option, although both GNU find and FreeBSD find support it.\nShebang line\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide which one to use, by writing the «shebang» line as the very first line of the script.\nE.g.\n#!/bin/sh\n\nwill use sh (and whatever that happens to point to),\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwill use /bin/bash if it's available (and fail with an error message if it's not). Of course, you can also specify another implementation, e.g.\n#!/bin/dash\n\nWhich one to use\nFor my own scripts, I prefer sh for the following reasons:\n\nit is standardized\nit is much simpler and easier to learn\nit is portable across POSIX systems — even if they happen not to have bash, they are required to have sh\n\nThere are advantages to using bash as well. Its features make programming more convenient and similar to programming in other modern programming languages. These include things like scoped local variables and arrays. Plain sh is a very minimalistic programming language."

You can delete a remote branch using the rather obtuse syntax git push [remotename] :[branch]. If you want to delete your serverfix branch from the server, you run the following:\n$ git push origin :serverfix\nTo git@github.com:schacon/simplegit.git\n - [deleted]         serverfix\n\nBoom. No more branches on your server. You may want to dog-ear this page, because you’ll need that command, and you’ll likely forget the syntax. A way to remember this command is by recalling the git push [remotename] [localbranch]:[remotebranch] syntax that we went over a bit earlier. If you leave off the [localbranch] portion, then you’re basically saying, “Take nothing on my side and make it be [remotebranch].”\n\nI ran git push origin :bugfix, and it worked beautifully.

You could reset to throw them away; you could stash, checkout, stash pop to take them with you; you could commit them to a branch there if you want a branch there.)\nHard delete unpublished commits\nIf, on the other hand, you want to really get rid of everything you've done since then, there are two possibilities. One, if you haven't published any of these commits, simply reset:\n# This will destroy any local modifications.\n# Don't do it if you have uncommitted work you want to keep.\ngit reset --hard 0d1d7fc32\n\n# Alternatively, if there's work to keep:\ngit stash\ngit reset --hard 0d1d7fc32\ngit stash pop\n# This saves the modifications, then reapplies that patch after resetting.\n# You could get merge conflicts, if you've modified things which were\n# changed since the commit you reset to.\n\nIf you mess up, you've already thrown away your local changes, but you can at least get back to where you were before by resetting again.\nUndo published commits with new commits\nOn the other hand, if you've published the work, you probably don't want to reset the branch, since that's effectively rewriting history. In that case, you could indeed revert the commits. In many enterprise organisations, the concept of \"protected\" branches will even prevent history from being rewritten on some major branches. In this case, reverting is your only option.\nWith Git, revert has a very specific meaning: create a commit with the reverse patch to cancel it out. This way you don't rewrite any history.\nFirst figure out what commits to revert. Depending on the technique chosen below, you want to either revert only the merge commits, or only the non-merge commits.\n\n# This lists all merge commits between 0d1d7fc and HEAD:\ngit log --merges --pretty=format:\"%h\" 0d1d7fc..HEAD | tr '\\n' ' '\n\n# This lists all non merge commits between 0d1d7fc and HEAD:\ngit log --no-merges --pretty=format:\"%h\" 0d1d7fc..HEAD | tr '\\n' ' '\n\nNote: if you revert multiple commits, the order matters. Start with the most recent commit.\n# This will create three separate revert commits, use non merge commits only:\ngit revert a867b4af 25eee4ca 0766c053\n\n# It also takes ranges. This will revert the last two commits:\ngit revert HEAD~2..HEAD\n\n# Similarly, you can revert a range of commits using commit hashes (non inclusive of first hash):\ngit revert 0d1d7fc..a867b4a\n\n# Reverting a merge commit. You can also use a range of merge commits here.\ngit revert -m 1 <merge_commit_sha>\n\n# To get just one, you could use `rebase -i` to squash them afterwards\n# Or, you could do it manually (be sure to do this at top level of the repo)\n# get your index and work tree into the desired state, without changing HEAD:\ngit checkout 0d1d7fc32 .\n\n# Then commit. Be sure and write a good message describing what you just did\ngit commit\n\nThe git-revert manpage actually covers a lot of this in its description. Another useful link is this git-scm.com section discussing git-revert.\nIf you decide you didn't want to revert after all, you can revert the revert (as described here) or reset back to before the revert (see the previous section).\nYou may also find this answer helpful in this case:\nHow can I move HEAD back to a previous location?

    "question": "Move the most recent commit(s) to a new branch with Git",
    "answer": "WARNING: You need to store uncommitted edits to your stash before doing this, using git stash. Once complete, you can retrieve the stashed uncommitted edits with git stash pop. git reset hard command will remove all changes!\nMoving to an existing branch\nIf you want to move your commits to an existing branch, it will look like this:\ngit checkout existingbranch\ngit merge branchToMoveCommitFrom\ngit checkout branchToMoveCommitFrom\ngit reset --hard HEAD~3 # Go back 3 commits. You *will* lose uncommitted work.\ngit checkout existingbranch\n\nMoving to a new branch\nWARNING: This method works because you are creating a new branch with the first command: git branch newbranch. If you want to move commits to an existing branch you need to merge your changes into the existing branch before executing git reset --hard HEAD~3 (see Moving to an existing branch above). If you don't merge your changes first, they will be lost.\nUnless there are other circumstances involved, this can be easily done by branching and rolling back.\n\n# Note: Any changes not committed will be lost.\ngit branch newbranch      # Create a new branch, saving the desired commits\ngit checkout master       # checkout master, this is the place you want to go back\ngit reset --hard HEAD~3   # Move master back by 3 commits (Make sure you know how many commits you need to go back)\ngit checkout newbranch    # Go to the new branch that still has the desired commits\n\nBut do make sure how many commits to go back. Alternatively, you can instead of HEAD~3, simply provide the hash of the commit (or the reference like origin/master) you want to \"revert back to\" on the master (/current) branch, e.g:\ngit reset --hard a1b2c3d4\n\nNote: You will only be \"losing\" commits from the master branch, but don't worry, you'll have those commits in newbranch! An easy way to check that, after completing the 4 step sequence of commands above, is by looking at git log -n4 which will show the history of newbranch actually retained the 3 commits (and the reason is that newbranch was created at the time those changes were already commited on master!). They have only been removed from master, as git reset only affected the branch that was checked out at the time of its execution, i.e. master (see git reset description: Reset current HEAD to the specified state). git status however will not show any checkouts on the newbranch, which might be surprising at first but that is actually expected.\nLastly, you may need to force push your latest changes to main repo:\ngit push origin master --force\n\nWARNING: With Git version 2.0 and later, if you later git rebase the new branch upon the original (master) branch, you may need an explicit --no-fork-point option during the rebase to avoid losing the carried-over commits.  Having branch.autosetuprebase always set makes this more likely.  See John Mellor's answer for details."

If you are trying to reset to the default branch in a more recent repository, it is likely that it will be main.\nBTW, this situation that you're in looks an awful lot like a common case where a push has been done into the currently checked out branch of a non-bare repository. Did you recently push into your local repo? If not, then no worries -- something else must have caused these files to unexpectedly end up modified.

If your git is new enough you can use this command, but the documentation comes with a warning:\n\nTHIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. THE BEHAVIOR MAY CHANGE.\n\nBecause git restore is experimental, it should not yet be promoted as the primary answer to this question.

    "question": "How do I squash my last N commits together?",

In this example, we'll squash the last 3 commits.\nIf you want to write the new commit message from scratch, this suffices:\ngit reset --soft HEAD~3\ngit commit\n\nIf you want to start editing the new commit message with a concatenation of the existing commit messages (i.e. similar to what a pick/squash/squash/…/squash git rebase -i instruction list would start you with), then you need to extract those messages and pass them to git commit:\ngit reset --soft HEAD~3 && \ngit commit --edit -m\"$(git log --format=%B --reverse HEAD..HEAD@{1})\"\n\nBoth of those methods squash the last three commits into a single new commit in the same way. The soft reset just re-points HEAD to the last commit that you do not want to squash. Neither the index nor the working tree are touched by the soft reset, leaving the index in the desired state for your new commit (i.e. it already has all the changes from the commits that you are about to “throw away”).\nEdit Based on Comments\nBecause git reset and git rebase rewrite history, you must use the --force flag to push the modified branch to the remote. This is what the --force flag is meant for. You can also be extra careful and fully define your target:\ngit push --force-with-lease origin <branch-name>"

Then you can fetch all the branches from that upstream repository, and rebase your work to continue working on the upstream version.

However, for making further pull requests that are as clean as possible, it's probably better to rebase.\n\nIf you've rebased your branch onto upstream/main you may need to force the push in order to push it to your own forked repository on GitHub.

    "answer": "The problem is that Xcode Command-line Tools needs to be updated due to a MacOs update.\n\nDid not run into this on Sonoma.\n\nMaybe Apple fixed the process?\n\n\nUpdated for Ventura\n\nAfter opening the terminal after restarting, I tried to go to my code, and do a git status, and I got an error and prompt for command line software agreement:\nSo press space until you get to the [agree, print, cancel] option, so careful hit space to scroll down to the end, if you blow past It you have to run a command to get it back. Use sudo xcodebuild -license to get to it again.\nJust be careful on scrolling down and enter agree and press return and it will launch into an update.\n\nThen I tried to use git after the install, and it prompted me to install Xcode tools again.\nI followed my own advice from previous years (see below), and went to https://developer.apple.com/download/all and downloaded\n\"Command Line Tools for Xcode 14\" (You have to log in with your Apple ID and enter MFA code, so have all the devices you need for that handy. Then select \"Command Line Tools for Xcode 14\", or if you want to get into the alphas or betas, that's up to you. But stable releases are probably the best choice for software developers.\n\nYou have to either download the tools from CLI or the developer page and before you can use git, you need to reboot!!! Or you will get stuck in a loop of prompt & downloading\nRebooting will break the loop and complete the installation of your CLI tools including git so that you can get back to work\nSolutions for previous years, these may or may not be valid these days as the downloads page has changed significantly:\nPREVIOUS YEARS SOLUTIONS, probably #2 is most helpful.\n*** Solution #1:\nGo back to your terminal and enter:\nxcode-select --install\n\nYou'll then receive the following output:\nxcode-select: note: install requested for command line developer tools\n\nYou will then be prompted in a window to update Xcode Command Line tools. (which could take a while)\nOpen a new terminal window and your development tools should be returned.\nAddition: With any major or semi-major update you'll need to update the command line tools in order to get them functioning properly again. Check Xcode with any update. This goes beyond Mojave...\nAfter that restart your terminal\nAlternatively, IF that fails, and it might.... you'll get a pop-up box saying \"Software not found on server\", proceed to solution 2.\n*** Solution #2: (Preferred method)\nIf you hit xcode-select --install and it doesn't find the software, log into Apple Developer, and install it via webpage.\nLog in or sign up here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/download/more/\nLook for: \"Command Line Tools for Xcode 14.x\" in the list of downloads\nThen click the dmg and download.

    "question": "Is there an equivalent of &#39;which&#39; on the Windows command line?",
    "answer": "I suggest you use Windows PowerShell's Get-Command cmdlet, as described in another answer to this question by Marawan Mamdouh.\nIf you're like me and don't use PowerShell, use Windows' where.exe program. Like Unix which, it shows the full path that would match the filename-only command you type:\nC:\\> where edit\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\edit.com\n\nUnlike which, where.exe can show all the paths that match the given filename, though only the first one shown would normally be used when launching a program:\nC:\\> where notepad\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe\nC:\\Windows\\notepad.exe\n\nwhere.exe tries to follow the Windows command shell CMD.EXE's rules for what file names and paths work as commands. That includes the %PATHEXT% environment variable and the ability to open non-program data files using their filenames with extensions:\nC:\\> set pathext\nPATHEXT=.COM;.EXE;.BAT;.CMD;.VBS;.VBE;.JS;.JSE;.WSF;.WSH;.MSC\n\nC:\\> where Enterprise.xml slmgr\nC:\\Windows\\Enterprise.xml\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\slmgr.vbs\n\nwhere.exe will even accept wildcards, so where nt*.exe finds all files in your %PATH% and current directory whose names start with nt and end with .exe:\nC:\\> where nt*.exe\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\ntoskrnl.exe\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\ntprint.exe\nC:\\Windows\\System32\\ntvdm.exe\n\nCheck the online docs for where.exe or run where.exe /? for more help.\n\nNotes:\n\nWhen using PowerShell, run where.exe as where.exe, never where. Plain where in PowerShell is an alias for the Where-Object cmdlet, which does something very different from where.exe / which.\nwhere.exe is available in Windows Server 2003 and later.

The only way to specify different arguments for a prerequisite would be to invoke it explicitly within the dependent task action, as in :invoke_my_task and :invoke_my_task_2.\n\nNote that some shells (like zsh) require you to escape the brackets: rake my_task\\['arg1'\\]"

    "question": "Including all the jars in a directory within the Java classpath",
    "answer": "Using Java 6 or later, the classpath option supports wildcards. Note the following:\n\nUse straight quotes (\")\nUse *, not *.jar\n\nWindows\n\njava -cp \"Test.jar;lib/*\" my.package.MainClass\n\nUnix\n\njava -cp \"Test.jar:lib/*\" my.package.MainClass\n\nThis is similar to Windows, but uses : instead of ;. If you cannot use wildcards, bash allows the following syntax (where lib is the directory containing all the Java archive files):\n\njava -cp \"$(printf %s: lib/*.jar)\"\n\n(Note that using a classpath is incompatible with the -jar option. See also: Execute jar file with multiple classpath libraries from command prompt)\nUnderstanding Wildcards\nFrom the Classpath document:\n\nClass path entries can contain the basename wildcard character *, which is considered equivalent to specifying a list of all the files\nin the directory with the extension .jar or .JAR. For example, the\nclass path entry foo/* specifies all JAR files in the directory named\nfoo. A classpath entry consisting simply of * expands to a list of all\nthe jar files in the current directory.\nA class path entry that contains * will not match class files. To\nmatch both classes and JAR files in a single directory foo, use either\nfoo;foo/* or foo/*;foo. The order chosen determines whether the\nclasses and resources in foo are loaded before JAR files in foo, or\nvice versa.\nSubdirectories are not searched recursively. For example, foo/* looks\nfor JAR files only in foo, not in foo/bar, foo/baz, etc.\nThe order in which the JAR files in a directory are enumerated in the\nexpanded class path is not specified and may vary from platform to\nplatform and even from moment to moment on the same machine. A\nwell-constructed application should not depend upon any particular\norder. If a specific order is required then the JAR files can be\nenumerated explicitly in the class path.\nExpansion of wildcards is done early, prior to the invocation of a\nprogram's main method, rather than late, during the class-loading\nprocess itself. Each element of the input class path containing a\nwildcard is replaced by the (possibly empty) sequence of elements\ngenerated by enumerating the JAR files in the named directory. For\nexample, if the directory foo contains a.jar, b.jar, and c.jar, then\nthe class path foo/* is expanded into foo/a.jar;foo/b.jar;foo/c.jar,\nand that string would be the value of the system property\njava.class.path.\nThe CLASSPATH environment variable is not treated any differently from\nthe -classpath (or -cp) command-line option. That is, wildcards are\nhonored in all these cases. However, class path wildcards are not\nhonored in the Class-Path jar-manifest header.\n\nNote: due to a known bug in java 8, the windows examples must use a backslash preceding entries with a trailing asterisk: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8131329"

    "question": "Adding a directory to the PATH environment variable in Windows",
    "answer": "Option 1\nAfter you change PATH with the GUI, close and reopen the console window. This works because only programs started after the change will \"see\" the new PATH. This is because when you change the PATH environment variable using the GUI tool, it updates the variable for future processes but not for anything currently running.\nOption 2\nThis option only affects your current shell session, not the whole system. Execute this command in the command window you have open:\nset PATH=%PATH%;C:\\your\\path\\here\\\n\nThis command appends C:\\your\\path\\here\\ to the current PATH. If your path includes spaces, you do not need to include quotation marks.\nBreaking it down:\n\nset – A command that changes cmd's environment variables only for the current cmd session; other programs and the system are unaffected.\nPATH= – This signifies that PATH is the environment variable to be temporarily changed.\n%PATH%;C:\\your\\path\\here\\ – The %PATH% part expands to the current value of PATH, and ;C:\\your\\path\\here\\ is then concatenated to it.

The first author also added this as a comment next to the code using this solution giving the URL to this answer, which now also includes the explanation for why the quotes can be safely omitted.\n(Often) The wrong way\nif [ -z \"$var\" ]; then echo \"var is blank\"; else echo \"var is set to '$var'\"; fi\n\nThis is often wrong because it doesn't distinguish between a variable that is unset and a variable that is set to the empty string. That is to say, if var='', then the above solution will output \"var is blank\".\nThe distinction between unset and \"set to the empty string\" is essential in situations where the user has to specify an extension, or additional list of properties, and that not specifying them defaults to a non-empty value, whereas specifying the empty string should make the script use an empty extension or list of additional properties.\nThe distinction may not be essential in every scenario though.

    "question": "Difference between sh and Bash",
    "answer": "What is sh?\nsh (or the Shell Command Language) is a programming language described by the POSIX standard. It has many implementations (ksh88, Dash, ...). Bash can also be considered an implementation of sh (see below).\nBecause sh is a specification, not an implementation, /bin/sh is a symlink (or a hard link) to an actual implementation on most POSIX systems.\nWhat is Bash?\nBash started as an sh-compatible implementation (although it predates the POSIX standard by a few years), but as time passed it has acquired many extensions. Many of these extensions may change the behavior of valid POSIX shell scripts, so by itself Bash is not a valid POSIX shell. Rather, it is a dialect of the POSIX shell language.\nBash supports a --posix switch, which makes it more POSIX-compliant. It also tries to mimic POSIX if invoked as sh.\nsh = bash?\nFor a long time, /bin/sh used to point to /bin/bash on most GNU/Linux systems. As a result, it had almost become safe to ignore the difference between the two. But that started to change recently.\nSome popular examples of systems where /bin/sh does not point to /bin/bash (and on some of which /bin/bash may not even exist) are:\n\nModern Debian and Ubuntu systems, which symlink sh to dash by default;\nBusybox, which is usually run during the Linux system boot time as part of initramfs. It uses the ash shell implementation.\nBSD systems, and in general any non-Linux systems. OpenBSD uses pdksh, a descendant of the KornShell. FreeBSD's sh is a descendant of the original Unix Bourne shell.  Solaris has its own sh which for a long time was not POSIX-compliant; a free implementation is available from the Heirloom project.\n\nHow can you find out what /bin/sh points to on your system?\nThe complication is that /bin/sh could be a symbolic link or a hard link. If it's a symbolic link, a portable way to resolve it is:\n% file -h /bin/sh\n/bin/sh: symbolic link to bash\n\nIf it's a hard link, try\n% find -L /bin -samefile /bin/sh\n/bin/sh\n/bin/bash\n\nIn fact, the -L flag covers both symlinks and hardlinks,\nbut the disadvantage of this method is that it is not portable —\nPOSIX does not require find to support the -samefile option, although both GNU find and FreeBSD find support it.\nShebang line\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide which one to use, by writing the «shebang» line as the very first line of the script.\nE.g.\n#!/bin/sh\n\nwill use sh (and whatever that happens to point to),\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwill use /bin/bash if it's available (and fail with an error message if it's not). Of course, you can also specify another implementation, e.g.\n#!/bin/dash\n\nWhich one to use\nFor my own scripts, I prefer sh for the following reasons:\n\nit is standardized\nit is much simpler and easier to learn\nit is portable across POSIX systems — even if they happen not to have bash, they are required to have sh\n\nThere are advantages to using bash as well. Its features make programming more convenient and similar to programming in other modern programming languages. These include things like scoped local variables and arrays. Plain sh is a very minimalistic programming language."

    "answer": "In all officially maintained versions of Python, the simplest approach is to use the subprocess.check_output function:\n>>> subprocess.check_output(['ls', '-l'])\nb'total 0\\n-rw-r--r--  1 memyself  staff  0 Mar 14 11:04 files\\n'\n\ncheck_output runs a single program that takes only arguments as input.1 It returns the result exactly as printed to stdout. If you need to write input to stdin, skip ahead to the run or Popen sections. If you want to execute complex shell commands, see the note on shell=True at the end of this answer.\nThe check_output function works in all officially maintained versions of Python. But for more recent versions, a more flexible approach is available.\nModern versions of Python (3.5 or higher): run\nIf you're using Python 3.5+, and do not need backwards compatibility, the new run function is recommended by the official documentation for most tasks. It provides a very general, high-level API for the subprocess module. To capture the output of a program, pass the subprocess.PIPE flag to the stdout keyword argument. Then access the stdout attribute of the returned CompletedProcess object:\n>>> import subprocess\n>>> result = subprocess.run(['ls', '-l'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)\n>>> result.stdout\nb'total 0\\n-rw-r--r--  1 memyself  staff  0 Mar 14 11:04 files\\n'\n\nThe return value is a bytes object, so if you want a proper string, you'll need to decode it. Assuming the called process returns a UTF-8-encoded string:\n>>> result.stdout.decode('utf-8')\n'total 0\\n-rw-r--r--  1 memyself  staff  0 Mar 14 11:04 files\\n'\n\nThis can all be compressed to a one-liner if desired:\n>>> subprocess.run(['ls', '-l'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE).stdout.decode('utf-8')\n'total 0\\n-rw-r--r--  1 memyself  staff  0 Mar 14 11:04 files\\n'\n\nIf you want to pass input to the process's stdin, you can pass a bytes object to the input keyword argument:\n>>> cmd = ['awk', 'length($0) > 5']\n>>> ip = 'foo\\nfoofoo\\n'.encode('utf-8')\n>>> result = subprocess.run(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, input=ip)\n>>> result.stdout.decode('utf-8')\n'foofoo\\n'\n\nYou can capture errors by passing stderr=subprocess.PIPE (capture to result.stderr) or stderr=subprocess.STDOUT (capture to result.stdout along with regular output). If you want run to throw an exception when the process returns a nonzero exit code, you can pass check=True. (Or you can check the returncode attribute of result above.) When security is not a concern, you can also run more complex shell commands by passing shell=True as described at the end of this answer.\nLater versions of Python streamline the above further. In Python 3.7+, the above one-liner can be spelled like this:\n>>> subprocess.run(['ls', '-l'], capture_output=True, text=True).stdout\n'total 0\\n-rw-r--r--  1 memyself  staff  0 Mar 14 11:04 files\\n'\n\nUsing run this way adds just a bit of complexity, compared to the old way of doing things. But now you can do almost anything you need to do with the run function alone.\nOlder versions of Python (3-3.4): more about check_output\nIf you are using an older version of Python, or need modest backwards compatibility, you can use the check_output function as briefly described above. It has been available since Python 2.7.\nsubprocess.check_output(*popenargs, **kwargs)  \n\nIt takes takes the same arguments as Popen (see below), and returns a string containing the program's output. The beginning of this answer has a more detailed usage example. In Python 3.5+, check_output is equivalent to executing run with check=True and stdout=PIPE, and returning just the stdout attribute.\nYou can pass stderr=subprocess.STDOUT to ensure that error messages are included in the returned output. When security is not a concern, you can also run more complex shell commands by passing shell=True as described at the end of this answer.\nIf you need to pipe from stderr or pass input to the process, check_output won't be up to the task. See the Popen examples below in that case.\nComplex applications and legacy versions of Python (2.6 and below): Popen\nIf you need deep backwards compatibility, or if you need more sophisticated functionality than check_output or run provide, you'll have to work directly with Popen objects, which encapsulate the low-level API for subprocesses.\nThe Popen constructor accepts either a single command without arguments, or a list containing a command as its first item, followed by any number of arguments, each as a separate item in the list. shlex.split can help parse strings into appropriately formatted lists. Popen objects also accept a host of different arguments for process IO management and low-level configuration.\nTo send input and capture output, communicate is almost always the preferred method. As in:\noutput = subprocess.Popen([\"mycmd\", \"myarg\"], \n                          stdout=subprocess.PIPE).communicate()[0]\n\nOr\n>>> import subprocess\n>>> p = subprocess.Popen(['ls', '-a'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, \n...                                    stderr=subprocess.PIPE)\n>>> out, err = p.communicate()\n>>> print out\n.\n..\nfoo\n\nIf you set stdin=PIPE, communicate also allows you to pass data to the process via stdin:\n>>> cmd = ['awk', 'length($0) > 5']\n>>> p = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,\n...                           stderr=subprocess.PIPE,\n...                           stdin=subprocess.PIPE)\n>>> out, err = p.communicate('foo\\nfoofoo\\n')\n>>> print out\nfoofoo\n\nNote Aaron Hall's answer, which indicates that on some systems, you may need to set stdout, stderr, and stdin all to PIPE (or DEVNULL) to get communicate to work at all.\nIn some rare cases, you may need complex, real-time output capturing. Vartec's answer suggests a way forward, but methods other than communicate are prone to deadlocks if not used carefully.\nAs with all the above functions, when security is not a concern, you can run more complex shell commands by passing shell=True.\nNotes\n1. Running shell commands: the shell=True argument\nNormally, each call to run, check_output, or the Popen constructor executes a single program. That means no fancy bash-style pipes. If you want to run complex shell commands, you can pass shell=True, which all three functions support. For example:\n>>> subprocess.check_output('cat books/* | wc', shell=True, text=True)\n' 1299377 17005208 101299376\\n'\n\nHowever, doing this raises security concerns. If you're doing anything more than light scripting, you might be better off calling each process separately, and passing the output from each as an input to the next, via\nrun(cmd, [stdout=etc...], input=other_output)\n\nOr\nPopen(cmd, [stdout=etc...]).communicate(other_output)\n\nThe temptation to directly connect pipes is strong; resist it. Otherwise, you'll likely see deadlocks or have to do hacky things like this."

The alternative would be to hard code something like #!/usr/bin/python; that's ok, but less flexible.\nIn Unix, an executable file that's meant to be interpreted can indicate what interpreter to use by having a #! at the start of the first line, followed by the interpreter (and any flags it may need).\nIf you're talking about other platforms, of course, this rule does not apply (but that \"shebang line\" does no harm, and will help if you ever copy that script to a platform with a Unix base, such as Linux, Mac, etc.)."

  {
    "question": "How do I profile C++ code running on Linux?",
    "answer": "If your goal is to use a profiler, use one of the suggested ones.\nHowever, if you're in a hurry and you can manually interrupt your program under the debugger while it's being subjectively slow, there's a simple way to find performance problems.\nExecute your code in a debugger like gdb, halt it and each time look at the call stack (e.g. backtrace) several times. If there is some code that is wasting some percentage of the time, 20% or 50% or whatever, that is the probability that you will catch it in the act on each sample. So, that is roughly the percentage of samples on which you will see it. There is no educated guesswork required. If you do have a guess as to what the problem is, this will prove or disprove it.\nYou probably have multiple performance problems of different sizes. If you clean out any one of them, the remaining ones will take a larger percentage, and be easier to spot, on subsequent passes. This magnification effect, when compounded over multiple problems, can lead to truly massive speedup factors.\nCaveat: Programmers tend to be skeptical of this technique unless they've used it themselves. They will say that profilers give you this information, but that is only true if they sample the entire call stack, and then let you examine a random set of samples. (The summaries are where the insight is lost.) Call graphs don't give you the same information, because\n\nThey don't summarize at the instruction level, and\nThey give confusing summaries in the presence of recursion.\n\nThey will also say it only works on toy programs, when actually it works on any program, and it seems to work better on bigger programs, because they tend to have more problems to find. They will say it sometimes finds things that aren't problems, but that is only true if you see something once. If you see a problem on more than one sample, it is real.\nP.S. This can also be done on multi-thread programs if there is a way to collect call-stack samples of the thread pool at a point in time, as there is in Java.\nP.P.S As a rough generality, the more layers of abstraction you have in your software, the more likely you are to find that that is the cause of performance problems (and the opportunity to get speedup).\nAdded: It might not be obvious, but the stack sampling technique works equally well in the presence of recursion. The reason is that the time that would be saved by removal of an instruction is approximated by the fraction of samples containing it, regardless of the number of times it may occur within a sample.\nAnother objection I often hear is: \"It will stop someplace random, and it will miss the real problem\".\nThis comes from having a prior concept of what the real problem is.\nA key property of performance problems is that they defy expectations.\nSampling tells you something is a problem, and your first reaction is disbelief.\nThat is natural, but you can be sure if it finds a problem it is real, and vice-versa.\nAdded: Let me make a Bayesian explanation of how it works.  Suppose there is some instruction I (call or otherwise) which is on the call stack some fraction f of the time (and thus costs that much). For simplicity, suppose we don't know what f is, but assume it is either 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ... 0.9, 1.0, and the prior probability of each of these possibilities is 0.1, so all of these costs are equally likely a-priori.\nThen suppose we take just 2 stack samples, and we see instruction I on both samples, designated observation o=2/2. This gives us new estimates of the frequency f of I, according to this:\nPrior\nP(f=x) x  P(o=2/2|f=x) P(o=2/2&&f=x)  P(o=2/2&&f >= x)  P(f >= x | o=2/2)\n\n0.1    1     1             0.1          0.1            0.25974026\n0.1    0.9   0.81          0.081        0.181          0.47012987\n0.1    0.8   0.64          0.064        0.245          0.636363636\n0.1    0.7   0.49          0.049        0.294          0.763636364\n0.1    0.6   0.36          0.036        0.33           0.857142857\n0.1    0.5   0.25          0.025        0.355          0.922077922\n0.1    0.4   0.16          0.016        0.371          0.963636364\n0.1    0.3   0.09          0.009        0.38           0.987012987\n0.1    0.2   0.04          0.004        0.384          0.997402597\n0.1    0.1   0.01          0.001        0.385          1\n\n                  P(o=2/2) 0.385\n\nThe last column says that, for example, the probability that f >= 0.5 is 92%, up from the prior assumption of 60%.\nSuppose the prior assumptions are different.

So Bayes allows us to update our estimate of the probable cost of I. If the amount of data is small, it doesn't tell us accurately what the cost is, only that it is big enough to be worth fixing.\nYet another way to look at it is called the Rule Of Succession.\nIf you flip a coin 2 times, and it comes up heads both times, what does that tell you about the probable weighting of the coin?\nThe respected way to answer is to say that it's a Beta distribution, with average value (number of hits + 1) / (number of tries + 2) = (2+1)/(2+2) = 75%.\n(The key is that we see I more than once. If we only see it once, that doesn't tell us much except that f > 0.)\nSo, even a very small number of samples can tell us a lot about the cost of instructions that it sees. (And it will see them with a frequency, on average, proportional to their cost. If n samples are taken, and f is the cost, then I will appear on nf+/-sqrt(nf(1-f)) samples. Example, n=10, f=0.3, that is 3+/-1.4 samples.)\n\nAdded: To give an intuitive feel for the difference between measuring and random stack sampling:\nThere are profilers now that sample the stack, even on wall-clock time, but what comes out is measurements (or hot path, or hot spot, from which a \"bottleneck\" can easily hide). What they don't show you (and they easily could) is the actual samples themselves. And if your goal is to find the bottleneck, the number of them you need to see is, on average, 2 divided by the fraction of time it takes.\nSo if it takes 30% of time, 2/.3 = 6.7 samples, on average, will show it, and the chance that 20 samples will show it is 99.2%.\nHere is an off-the-cuff illustration of the difference between examining measurements and examining stack samples.\nThe bottleneck could be one big blob like this, or numerous small ones, it makes no difference.\n\nMeasurement is horizontal; it tells you what fraction of time specific routines take.\nSampling is vertical.\nIf there is any way to avoid what the whole program is doing at that moment, and if you see it on a second sample, you've found the bottleneck.\nThat's what makes the difference - seeing the whole reason for the time being spent, not just how much."

Here is a demonstration:\nwhile true; do\n    read -p \"Do you wish to install this program? \" yn\n    case $yn in\n        [Yy]* ) make install; break;;\n        [Nn]* ) exit;;\n        * ) echo \"Please answer yes or no.\";;\n    esac\ndone\n\n\nAnother method, pointed out by Steven Huwig, is Bash's select command. Here is the same example using select:\necho \"Do you wish to install this program?\"\nselect yn in \"Yes\" \"No\"; do\n    case $yn in\n        Yes ) make install; break;;\n        No ) exit;;\n    esac\ndone\n\nWith select you don't need to sanitize the input – it displays the available choices, and you type a number corresponding to your choice. It also loops automatically, so there's no need for a while true loop to retry if they give invalid input. If you want to allow more flexible input (accepting the words of the options, rather than just their number), you can alter it like this:\necho \"Do you wish to install this program?\"\nselect strictreply in \"Yes\" \"No\"; do\n    relaxedreply=${strictreply:-$REPLY}\n    case $relaxedreply in\n        Yes | yes | y ) make install; break;;\n        No  | no  | n ) exit;;\n    esac\ndone\n\n\nAlso, Léa Gris demonstrated a way to make the request language agnostic in her answer. Adapting my first example to better serve multiple languages might look like this:\nset -- $(locale LC_MESSAGES)\nyesexpr=\"$1\"; noexpr=\"$2\"; yesword=\"$3\"; noword=\"$4\"\n\nwhile true; do\n    read -p \"Install (${yesword} / ${noword})? \" yn\n    if [[ \"$yn\" =~ $yesexpr ]]; then make install; exit; fi\n    if [[ \"$yn\" =~ $noexpr ]]; then exit; fi\n    echo \"Answer ${yesword} / ${noword}.\"\ndone\n\nObviously other communication strings remain untranslated here (Install, Answer) which would need to be addressed in a more fully completed translation, but even a partial translation would be helpful in many cases.\n\nFinally, please check out the excellent answer by F. Hauri."

    "question": "What is &#39;:-!!&#39; in C?",
    "answer": "This is, in effect, a way to check whether the expression e can be evaluated to be 0, and if not, to fail the build.\n\nThe macro is somewhat misnamed; it should be something more like BUILD_BUG_OR_ZERO, rather than ...ON_ZERO. (There have been occasional discussions about whether this is a confusing name.)\n\nYou should read the expression like this:\n\nsizeof(struct { int: -!!(e); }))\n\n\n\n(e): Compute expression e.\n!!(e): Logically negate twice: 0 if e == 0; otherwise 1.\n-!!(e): Numerically negate the expression from step 2: 0 if it was 0; otherwise -1.\nstruct{int: -!!(0);} --> struct{int: 0;}: If it was zero, then we declare a struct with an anonymous integer bitfield that has width zero. Everything is fine and we proceed as normal.\nstruct{int: -!!(1);} --> struct{int: -1;}: On the other hand, if it isn't zero, then it will be some negative number. Declaring any bitfield with negative width is a compilation error.\n\n\nSo we'll either wind up with a bitfield that has width 0 in a struct, which is fine, or a bitfield with negative width, which is a compilation error. Then we take sizeof that field, so we get a size_t with the appropriate width (which will be zero in the case where e is zero).\n\n\n\nSome people have asked: Why not just use an assert?\n\nkeithmo's answer here has a good response:\n\n\n  These macros implement a compile-time test, while assert() is a run-time test.\n\n\nExactly right. You don't want to detect problems in your kernel at runtime that could have been caught earlier! It's a critical piece of the operating system. To whatever extent problems can be detected at compile time, so much the better."

If you want a process to make use of this variable, use export, and run the process from that shell.\nname=value\n\nmeans the variable scope is restricted to the shell, and is not available to any other process. You would use this for (say) loop variables, temporary variables etc. An important exception to this rule is that if you define the variable while running a command, that variable will be available to child processes. For example\nMY_VAR=yay node my-script.js\n\nIn this case MY_VAR will be available to the node process running my-script.\nIt's important to note that exporting a variable doesn't make it available to parent processes.

    "question": "How do I print colored text to the terminal?",
    "answer": "This somewhat depends on what platform you are on. The most common way to do this is by printing ANSI escape sequences. For a simple example, here's some Python code from the Blender build scripts:\nclass bcolors:\n    HEADER = '\\033[95m'\n    OKBLUE = '\\033[94m'\n    OKCYAN = '\\033[96m'\n    OKGREEN = '\\033[92m'\n    WARNING = '\\033[93m'\n    FAIL = '\\033[91m'\n    ENDC = '\\033[0m'\n    BOLD = '\\033[1m'\n    UNDERLINE = '\\033[4m'\n\nTo use code like this, you can do something like:\nprint(bcolors.WARNING + \"Warning: No active frommets remain. Continue?\" + bcolors.ENDC)\n\nOr, with Python 3.6+:\nprint(f\"{bcolors.WARNING}Warning: No active frommets remain. Continue?{bcolors.ENDC}\")\n\nThis will work on unixes including OS X, Linux and Windows (provided you use ANSICON, or in Windows 10 provided you enable VT100 emulation). There are ANSI codes for setting the color, moving the cursor, and more.\nIf you are going to get complicated with this (and it sounds like you are if you are writing a game), you should look into the \"curses\" module, which handles a lot of the complicated parts of this for you. The Python Curses HowTO is a good introduction.\nIf you are not using extended ASCII (i.e., not on a PC), you are stuck with the ASCII characters below 127, and '#' or '@' is probably your best bet for a block. If you can ensure your terminal is using a IBM extended ASCII character set, you have many more options. Characters 176, 177, 178 and 219 are the \"block characters\".\nSome modern text-based programs, such as \"Dwarf Fortress\", emulate text mode in a graphical mode, and use images of the classic PC font. You can find some of these bitmaps that you can use on the Dwarf Fortress Wiki see (user-made tilesets).\nThe Text Mode Demo Contest has more resources for doing graphics in text mode."

The output of that ps pipeline inside that construct above is the list of process IDs so you end up with a command like kill 1234 1122 7654.\n\nHere's a transcript showing it in action:\npax> sleep 3600 &\n[1] 2225\npax> sleep 3600 &\n[2] 2226\npax> sleep 3600 &\n[3] 2227\npax> sleep 3600 &\n[4] 2228\npax> sleep 3600 &\n[5] 2229\npax> kill $(ps aux | grep '[s]leep' | awk '{print $2}')\n[5]+  Terminated              sleep 3600\n[1]   Terminated              sleep 3600\n[2]   Terminated              sleep 3600\n[3]-  Terminated              sleep 3600\n[4]+  Terminated              sleep 3600\n\nand you can see it terminating all the sleepers.\nExplaining the grep '[p]ython csp_build.py' bit in a bit more detail: when you do sleep 3600 & followed by ps -ef | grep sleep, you tend to get two processes with sleep in it, the sleep 3600 and the grep sleep (because they both have sleep in them, that's not rocket science).\nHowever, ps -ef | grep '[s]leep' won't create a grep process with sleep in it, it instead creates one with the command grep '[s]leep' and here's the tricky bit: the grep doesn't find that one, because it's looking for the regular expression \"any character from the character class [s] (which is basically just s) followed by leep.\nIn other words, it's looking for sleep but the grep process is grep '[s]leep' which doesn't have the text sleep in it.\nWhen I was shown this (by someone here on SO), I immediately started using it because\n\nit's one less process than adding | grep -v grep; and\nit's elegant and sneaky, a rare combination :-)\n\n\n(1) If you're not limited to using those basic tools, there's a nifty pgrep command which will find processes based on certain criteria (assuming you have it available on your system, of course).\nFor example, you can use pgrep sleep to output the process IDs for all sleep commands (by default, it matches the process name). If you want to match the entire command line as shown in ps, you can do something like pgrep -f 'sleep 9999'.\nAs an aside, it doesn't list itself if you do pgrep pgrep, so the tricky filter method shown above is not necessary in this case.\nYou can check that the processes are the ones you're interested in by using -a to show the full process names. You can also limit the scope to your own processes (or a specific set of users) with -u or -U. See the man page for pgrep/pkill for more options.\nOnce you're satisfied it will only show the processes you're interested in, you can then use pkill with the same parameters to send a signal to all those processes."

    "question": "psql: FATAL: role &quot;postgres&quot; does not exist",
    "answer": "NOTE: If you installed postgres using homebrew, see the comments from @user3402754 and @originalhat below.\nNote that the error message does NOT talk about a missing database, it talks about a missing role. Later in the login process it might also stumble over the missing database.\nBut the first step is to check the missing role: What is the output within psql of the command \\du ? On my Ubuntu system the relevant line looks like this:\n                              List of roles\n Role name |            Attributes             | Member of \n-----------+-----------------------------------+-----------\n postgres  | Superuser, Create role, Create DB | {}        \n\nIf there is not at least one role with superuser, then you have a problem :-)\nIf there is one, you can use that to login. And looking at the output of your \\l command: The permissions for user on the template0 and template1 databases are the same as on my Ubuntu system for the superuser postgres. So I think your setup simple uses user as the superuser. So you could try this command to login:\nsudo -u user psql user\n\nIf user is really the DB superuser you can create another DB superuser and a private, empty database for him:\nCREATE USER postgres SUPERUSER;\nCREATE DATABASE postgres WITH OWNER postgres;\n\nBut since your postgres.app setup does not seem to do this, you also should not. Simple adapt the tutorial."

    "question": "Open terminal here in Mac OS finder",
    "answer": "As of Mac OS X Lion 10.7, Terminal includes exactly this functionality as a Service. As with most Services, these are disabled by default, so you'll need to enable this to make it appear in the Services menu.\n\n\n  System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services\n\n\nEnable New Terminal at Folder. There's also New Terminal Tab at Folder, which will create a tab in the frontmost Terminal window (if any, else it will create a new window). These Services work in all applications, not just Finder, and they operate on folders as well as absolute pathnames selected in text.\n\nYou can even assign command keys to them.\n\nServices appear in the Services submenu of each application menu, and within the contextual menu (Control-Click or Right-Click on a folder or pathname).\n\nThe New Terminal at Folder service will become active when you select a folder in Finder. You cannot simply have the folder open and run the service \"in place\". Go back to the parent folder, select the relevant folder, then activate the service via the Services menu or context menu.\n\nIn addition, Lion Terminal will open a new terminal window if you drag a folder (or pathname) onto the Terminal application icon, and you can also drag to the tab bar of an existing window to create a new tab.\n\nFinally, if you drag a folder or pathname onto a tab (in the tab bar) and the foreground process is the shell, it will automatically execute a \"cd\" command. (Dragging into the terminal view within the tab merely inserts the pathname on its own, as in older versions of Terminal.)\n\nYou can also do this from the command line or a shell script:\n\nopen -a Terminal /path/to/folder\n\n\nThis is the command-line equivalent of dragging a folder/pathname onto the Terminal application icon.\n\nOn a related note, Lion Terminal also has new Services for looking up man pages: Open man page in Terminal displays the selected man page topic in a new terminal window, and Search man Pages in Terminal performs \"apropos\" on the selected text. The former also understands man page references (\"open(2)\"), man page command line arguments (\"2 open\") and man page URLs (\"x-man-page://2/open\")."

The table below lists the RGB values of the background and foreground colours used for these by a variety of terminal emulators:\n\nUsing the above, you can make red text on a green background (but why?) using:\n\\033[31;42m\n\n11 Colours (An Interlude)\nIn their book \"Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution\", Brent Berlin and Paul Kay used data collected from twenty different languages from a range of language families to identify eleven possible basic color categories: white, black, red, green, yellow, blue, brown, purple, pink, orange, and gray.\nBerlin and Kay found that, in languages with fewer than the maximum eleven color categories, the colors followed a specific evolutionary pattern. This pattern is as follows:\n\nAll languages contain terms for black (cool colours) and white (bright colours).\nIf a language contains three terms, then it contains a term for red.\nIf a language contains four terms, then it contains a term for either green or yellow (but not both).\nIf a language contains five terms, then it contains terms for both green and yellow.\nIf a language contains six terms, then it contains a term for blue.\nIf a language contains seven terms, then it contains a term for brown.\nIf a language contains eight or more terms, then it contains terms for purple, pink, orange or gray.\n\nThis may be why story Beowulf only contains the colours black, white, and red. Homer's Odyssey contains black almost 200 times and white about 100 times. Red appears 15 times, while yellow and green appear only 10 times. (More information here)\nDifferences between languages are also interesting: note the profusion of distinct colour words used by English vs. Chinese. However, digging deeper into these languages shows that each uses colour in distinct ways. (More information)\n\nGenerally speaking, the naming, use, and grouping of colours in human languages is fascinating. Now, back to the show.\n8-bit (256) colours\nTechnology advanced, and tables of 256 pre-selected colours became available, as shown below.\n\nUsing these above, you can make pink text like so:\n\\033[38;5;206m     #That is, \\033[38;5;<FG COLOR>m\n\nAnd make an early-morning blue background using\n\\033[48;5;57m      #That is, \\033[48;5;<BG COLOR>m\n\nAnd, of course, you can combine these:\n\\033[38;5;206;48;5;57m\n\nThe 8-bit colours are arranged like so:\n\n\n\nRange\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n0x00-0x07\nstandard colors (same as the 4-bit colours)\n\n\n0x08-0x0F\nhigh intensity colors\n\n\n0x10-0xE7\n6 × 6 × 6 cube (216 colors): 16 + 36 × r + 6 × g + b (0 ≤ r, g, b ≤ 5)\n\n\n0xE8-0xFF\ngrayscale from black to white in 24 steps\n\n\n\nALL THE COLOURS\nNow we are living in the future, and the full RGB spectrum is available using:\n\\033[38;2;<r>;<g>;<b>m     #Select RGB foreground color\n\\033[48;2;<r>;<g>;<b>m     #Select RGB background color\n\nSo you can put pinkish text on a brownish background using\n\\033[38;2;255;82;197;48;2;155;106;0mHello\n\nSupport for \"true color\" terminals is listed here.\nMuch of the above is drawn from the Wikipedia page \"ANSI escape code\".\nA Handy Script to Remind Yourself\nSince I'm often in the position of trying to remember what colours are what, I have a handy script called: ~/bin/ansi_colours:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nfor i in range(30, 37 + 1):\n    print(\"\\033[%dm%d\\t\\t\\033[%dm%d\" % (i, i, i + 60, i + 60))\n\nprint(\"\\033[39m\\\\033[49m                 - Reset color\")\nprint(\"\\\\033[2K                          - Clear Line\")\nprint(\"\\\\033[<L>;<C>H or \\\\033[<L>;<C>f  - Put the cursor at line L and column C.\")\nprint(\"\\\\033[<N>A                        - Move the cursor up N lines\")\nprint(\"\\\\033[<N>B                        - Move the cursor down N lines\")\nprint(\"\\\\033[<N>C                        - Move the cursor forward N columns\")\nprint(\"\\\\033[<N>D                        - Move the cursor backward N columns\\n\")\nprint(\"\\\\033[2J                          - Clear the screen, move to (0,0)\")\nprint(\"\\\\033[K                           - Erase to end of line\")\nprint(\"\\\\033[s                           - Save cursor position\")\nprint(\"\\\\033[u                           - Restore cursor position\\n\")\nprint(\"\\\\033[4m                          - Underline on\")\nprint(\"\\\\033[24m                         - Underline off\\n\")\nprint(\"\\\\033[1m                          - Bold on\")\nprint(\"\\\\033[21m                         - Bold off\")\n\nThis prints"

The . at the end of the above command opens the current working directory you are located in (again make sure you're in a directory that only contains a few files!).\nIf you DO NOT get Sublime Text opening your current working directory then the next set of steps will NOT work. If nothing happens or you get an error from Terminal it will be because it couldn't find the Sublime Text application. This would mean that you would have to check what you've typed (spelling, etc.) OR that Sublime Text isn't installed!\n\nCheck \".bash_profile\":\nNow it's time to create your symbolic link in your PATH folder, BUT, before we do, let's check your profile file by using nano ~/.bash_profile. These are the following lines that pertain to having subl work on the command line for Sublime Text:\n export PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH\n export EDITOR='subl -w'\n\nThe first line sets the location where you want Terminal to look for binaries on your machine, I'm going to store my symbolic link in the /usr/local/bin directory - I guess you could store it anywhere provided you've notified Terminal where to look for binaries.\nThe second line is OPTIONAL and just sets Sublime Text as the default editor. The flag -w has been added and you can find out more about flags by going to the Sublime Text docs: ST4 subl, ST3 subl or ST2 subl\nIf you do make any edits to this file once you have closed it, you need to run the command:\n source ~/.bash_profile \n\nto compile your newly applied edits. If you see any errors after sourcing your file get them fixed before moving to the final step.\n\nCreate a symbolic link to Sublime Text:\nNow in your chosen path (I used /usr/local/bin) you now enter the following command:\n ln -s /Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/subl\n\nThe /Applications/Sublime\\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl being EXACTLY the same location as what you entered and verified as working in STEP 1 above. The /usr/local/bin/subl being the location of where you want the symbolic link to be located - needs to be one of your PATH locations from STEP 2 above.\nNow when you navigate to a folder or file that you want to open in Sublime Text you now just enter subl followed by the name of the file or . to open the current working directory."
